# Quantity::Function serves to define a quantity as a function of
# another (parent) quantity. For example, CelsiusTemperature is
# defined as Temperature offset by 273.15. Many quantities are
# defined as simply scaled versions of their parent quantities
# (eg. MoleAmount vs. Amount is scaled by Ná´€). Since two-way
# conversion between parent and daughter quantities is needed, and
# since standard Proc fuctions are not easily invertible, instances
# of Quantity::Function carry both forward and inverse closure.
