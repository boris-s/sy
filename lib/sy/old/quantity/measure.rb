# Defines how a certain quantity (target quantity) is converted to another
# quantity (reference quantity). Has two attributes:
#
# * @r2t - Closure for converting from the reference quantity.
# * @t2r - closure for converting back to the reference quantity.
#
# Convenience methods #rt and #tr expose these closures for easy magnitude
# conversion.
